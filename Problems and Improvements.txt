Problems : 
    1. Main Problem I found in the dataset is that the task events, Without proper validation and sequence, the log may have tasks which says completed before starting.
    2.(the case where the task is stopped is also considered as done, pausing and then if user continued to spend time can also be considered as time spent on a task.)
    (Not implemented at the moment)
    3. The timestamp should be in ascending order, If we get the task as completed first and then the task start,
    we'll not be able to track it properly.
    4. There maybe some missing data in the sequence which may cause the time tracking result in wrong or unexpected results.
    

Solution : 

    1. Keep track of each user and his / her task which they spent the time on, By comparing the task start and task completed we can make sure.
    2. Sort the data based on timestamp, so that none of the task is completed before its started in log data file.
    3. generate report based on each user , the task and the time spent on each task.


Improvements : 
    1. We can add validation for the program to make sure the any particular task is started before it is stopped or completed.
    2. We can make sure that the log data is completely in sequence without any missing data.
